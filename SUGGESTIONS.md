# Suggestions

### Project
Great structure

### README
- Good work, needs more clearance on the structure

### INSTALL SCRIPT
- Missing - although not requested, could have saved me a time for a setup.

### Helm

- What's a point using helm `values.yaml` file if you are using static values in the charts ?
- Why not use containers built in previous tasks from docker hub ?
